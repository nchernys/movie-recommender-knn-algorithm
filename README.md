# üé¨ Movie Recommender

**Movie Recommender** is a full-stack application that allows users to browse a movie database and receive personalized recommendations based on similarity. It features a React (TypeScript) frontend and a Spring Boot (Java) backend with a machine learning component.

## üöÄ Features

- View all movies stored in the database
- Click on any movie to see its details and receive 5 similar movie recommendations
- Smart recommendation engine using a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** algorithm
- Weighted relevance boosting to prioritize key fields
- RESTful API architecture with **Axios** used for communication between the frontend and backend

## üß† Recommendation Logic

The backend recommendation engine evaluates similarity using multiple fields:

- **Description**
- **Genre** (boosted)
- **Country** (boosted)
- **Year** (boosted)

Fields like **genre**, **country**, and **year** are given higher weight to improve the relevance of recommendations, so movies that share these characteristics are prioritized.
